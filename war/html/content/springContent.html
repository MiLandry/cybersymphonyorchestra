    Spring is nothing more than somewhere your program can go to get an object with all of its information populated
</h2>
<p>
    According to StackOverflow, TutorialsPoint, Wikipedia, a plethora of other tutorial and learn-it-yourself sites, as well as a number of your fellow
    developers and colleagues will all parrot the same thing when talking about Spring:
</p>
<p>
    "It's a framework."
</p>
<p>
    "It's an Inversion of Control Container."
</p>
<p>
    "It achieves Loose Coupling."
</p>
<p>
    "It uses Dependency Injection."
</p>
<p>
    While most of these things are well and true, that is not what Spring is about. That doesn't explain its success and popularity. To me, Spring is nothing
    more than somewhere your program can go to get an object with all of its information populated. That is to say, it is an implementation of the Factory
    Pattern.
</p>
<p>
    I hate describing Spring in any other way; Spring solves a problem that is programming-specific, it can sound pretentious to IT professionals outside of
    development, and early coders will be overwhelmed with confusing jargon. For taking the first step in understanding Spring, all you need to know is that
    you can go ask spring to make you an object with all its dependencies already populated. Knowing that Spring implements the Factory Design pattern is much
    more useful to the user than understanding that dependencies are injected into beans. Mentioning Dependency Injection is confusing because that is the
    implementation of the factory, not the purpose or reason of Spring. Prospective Spring users are more likely to comprehend the need of some way to fetch
    pre-populated objects, rather than putting a framework that features an Inversion of Control container because concepts like Inversion of Control and
    Dependency Injection are solutions to problems that these users don't have; these concepts are the solutions to Spring's problems.
</p>
<p>
    And I am not really sure why people mention 'loose coupling' along with spring. Spring does not "achieve" Loose Coupling, programming to interfaces
    achieves loose coupling. Spring just saves you time when you actually join up your interfaces with your implementations.
</p>
<p>
    If we are going to attract more minds to the coding profession, we have to shore up (and, at times, correct) how we communicate our concepts of
    development.
